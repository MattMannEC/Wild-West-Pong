# Wild-West-Pong

This is my version of the Atari classic Pong using python and pygame. 

How is Wild-West-Pong different from classic Pong? Each paddle has the ability to shoot bullets. Bullet and ball collisions create ricochet effects changing the velocity of the ball. I have also added sound effects and a theme tune.

On unix, once python3 is installed run >> "python3 -m pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev6"

Navigate to pong folder and run "python3 pong.py"

Game developped on unix for retina 2560 x 1600 screen. Other screen sizes may give unexpected results.
